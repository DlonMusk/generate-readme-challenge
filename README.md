# 09 Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator

## Description

For this module we had to create a node.js application using the inquirer library that can quickly and dynamically generate a professional README.md file from a user's input by using the command-line alone. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project. 

## Getting Started
The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```
